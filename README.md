## Overview
Are you insecure about being unsecure? Do you think ALL HTTP requests are invalid? 

If you answered yes to any of these, you need the Barry HTTP server. 
## How it works

All requests MUST be returned with a `403 UNAUTHORIZED` status.

## FAQ

### Routes?
Nope, that's too unsecure

### Content Negotiation?
Though all HTTP is inherently unsecure, Barry HTTP will honor different HTTP clients including browsers, `application/json`, and `text/plain`, see screenshots below:

*text/plain*

### Do you accept Pull Requests?
Depends on if it is unsecure or not. Changing the return status code is considered unsecure.
